# We use the NodeMCU which is a WIFI development module, based on a system of chip (SoC: system on chip), Wi-Fi and ESP8266 microcontroller.
# We used the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). So for the IDE to manage the ESP8266 microcontroller, the ESP8266 library must be added to the Arduino configuration.
# The communication with the DHT11/DHT22 sensor is provided by the DHT library, which has its own communication protocol with a single bus (One Wire) for data transfer
# We used Firebase to create the database using a Json object and we use the network time protocol (NTP), which ensures adding real time and date to the firebase database.
